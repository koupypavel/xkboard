# The speed of the JTAG interface, in KHz. If you get DSR/DIR errors (and they
# do not relate to OpenOCD trying to read from a memory range without physical
# memory being present there), you can try lowering this.
 

# The TDI pin of ESP32 is also a bootstrap pin that selects the voltage the SPI flash
# chip runs at. When a hard reset happens (e.g. because someone switches the board off
# and on) the ESP32 will use the current TDI value as the bootstrap value because the
# JTAG adapter overrides the pull-up or pull-down resistor that is supposed to do the
# bootstrapping. These lines basically set the idle value of the TDO line to a
# specified value, therefore reducing the chance of a bad bootup due to a bad flash
# voltage greatly.
